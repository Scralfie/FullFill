# Gebru Team 2 - Lap 4 Final Project
## Title
Project FullFill

## Description
A fullstack project that aims to serve those facing food poverty by providing a one-stop-shop for both corporate and public volunteers to organise food donations and outreach, as well as for those in need to find local food banks.

## Product (USP)
- Not just providing a platform to find food banks, but also to allow people to organise themselves into grassroots volunteering groups to serve their local community.
- In times of community distress and emergencies, the local community can organise around a website that directly serves this purpose rather than on social media which is less focused on the immediate need

## MVP
### Must-haves:
- Food bank locator
- User authentication
- Ability to create and join community groups
- Food donation page where charities post what food they need
- Deployment

### Should-haves:
- Realtime chatroom in community page
- Events/blog post section -> Admin get to post

### Could-haves/Stretch Goals:
- Individual user profiles -> what community you are part of
- Add profile photo
- Mailers -> sign up for newsletter for this week's volunteering opportunities
