# Gebru Team 2 - Lap 4 Final Project
## Title
Project FullFill

## Description
A fullstack project that aims to serve those facing food poverty by providing a one-stop-shop for both corporate and public volunteers to organise food donations and outreach, as well as for those in need to find local food banks.

## Product (USP)
- Not just providing a platform to find food banks, but also to allow people to organise themselves into grassroots volunteering groups to serve their local community.
- In times of community distress and emergencies, the local community can organise around a website that directly serves this purpose rather than on social media which is less focused on the immediate need
